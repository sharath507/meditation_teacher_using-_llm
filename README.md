   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py

2. Open `index12.html` in a browser to access the meditation guide.

## Setting the API Key
Ensure you set up the OpenAI API key before running the project.
- Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following line:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
- Alternatively, you can set it in the terminal:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # For Linux/macOS
  set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here    # For Windows
  ```

1. Open `prompt_templates.py`.
2. Modify the `MEDITATION_SCRIPT_PROMPT` template.
3. Change parameters such as goal, duration, and voice tone.
4. Save the file and restart the server to apply changes.
